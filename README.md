# Learning Bash Scripts

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

To enable running a script upon click, you need to edit permissions. For example, for `chrome-incognito-shortcut.app`:

```bash
chmod 744 chrome-incognito-shortcut.app
```

## Random Note

Example of script used by Travis CI `npm run build` to copy files to `/public` folder: [copy-to-public-folder.sh](https://github.com/hchiam/hchiam.github.io/blob/master/copy-to-public-folder.sh)
